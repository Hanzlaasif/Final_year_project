        <h2 className=" text-yellow font-bold">Gamified Tracking</h2>
        <p className="text-white">
           Courier360 transforms traditional parcel tracking into a 
           visually engaging experience. Users can follow their delivery on a 
           live map with animated progress indicators and real-time status updates. 
           This not only increases transparency but also keeps customers more engaged 
           during the delivery process

        <h2 className=" text-yellow font-bold">Courier Traffic</h2>
        <p className="text-white">
         Admins and riders can view real-time courier traffic and 
         congestion zones on an integrated map. This helps in making 
         smarter delivery decisions, avoiding delays, and adjusting 
         ETAs dynamically. It’s especially useful during peak hours 
         or weather disruptions.

        <h2 className=" text-yellow font-bold">Freelance MarketPlace</h2>
        <p className="text-white">
         Courier360 allows verified freelance riders to register and 
         accept available delivery jobs. This flexible rider model helps 
         cover areas where full-time staff may not be available, 
         and reduces operational costs. Admins can monitor rider performance 
         and assign tasks based on location and availability.

        <h2 className=" text-yellow font-bold">Community Pickup</h2>
        <p className="text-white">
         Users can choose to send or receive parcels at partnered 
         local shops acting as pickup/drop-off points. This reduces 
         delivery costs, improves convenience, and ensures accessibility 
         in areas with limited direct delivery options. Shop owners manage 
         parcels using a simplified dashboard within the system.   
        </p>

        <h2 className=" text-yellow font-bold">Split Delivery</h2>
        <p className="text-white">
         Senders can divide a shipment into priority and standard parts 
         based on urgency. For example, urgent items can be delivered same-day, 
         while the rest follow normal delivery timelines. This gives users more 
         control over their deliveries and helps optimize rider schedules. 
        </p> 
    </div>
    <div className="max-w-5xl w-full mx-auto flex flex-col-reverse md:flex-row items-center space-y-10 md:space-y-0 md:space-x-10 px-6">
        <h2 className=" text-yellow font-bold">QR-based Verification</h2>
        <p className="text-white">
         To ensure safe and secure handover, each parcel is tagged with a unique 
         QR code. Riders must scan the QR code at pickup and delivery points, reducing 
         the risk of misplaced or unauthorized deliveries. This feature also provides a 
         digital proof-of-delivery trail for both senders and recipients. 
        </p> 
    </div>
    <div className="max-w-5xl w-full mx-auto flex flex-col-reverse md:flex-row items-center space-y-10 md:space-y-0 md:space-x-10 px-6">
        <h2 className=" text-yellow font-bold">Tips For Rider</h2>
        <p className="text-white">
         After each successful delivery, customers can rate their rider’s performance 
         and optionally leave a tip through the app. This builds a culture of appreciation 
         and encourages better service. Riders with higher ratings can be prioritized for more 
         tasks, improving overall platform reliability. 
        </p>

        <h2 className=" text-yellow font-bold">Small Businesses</h2>
        <p className="text-white">
         Tailored tools are available for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to manage their 
         shipments. Businesses can upload bulk orders, generate invoices, view delivery stats, 
         and track all parcels from a single dashboard. It’s a scalable, cost-effective solution 
         for regular senders
